## **Studies with C language**

* I started in the world of programming with the C Language. Programming logic and the creation of Algorithms to solve problems.
* I believe the best way to improve your programming performance when you're starting out in the development world is to practice with lots of exercises.
* I found these exercise lists on the internet, they belong to the Federal University of Uberl√¢ndia (UFU).
* I really liked the lists, as they cover very important features of the language that make it powerful. 
* This is something for me to remember the basics I learned through my learning with C language  during college.
* So, hope you enjoy it, as much I will!

* Any problem. Please contact me.
